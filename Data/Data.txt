The zipped files contain 18348 reviews (in total) from Pitchfork (every one they've done to August 30th, 2020). Due to error on my part, there may be some duplicates and potentially some missing reviews. The unzipped and unpickled form are two Pandas DataFrames that can be combined easily. For each entry, the following data is recorded

artist - Name of the music artist
album - Name of the album
score - Score that Pitchfork gave the album (out of 10)
labels - Labels associated to the album (presented as list)
genre - Genres associated to the album (presented as list)
year - Year of album (or reissue in many cases)
reviewer - Who wrote the review
title - Title of the person who wrote the review
pub_date - Year the review was published
abstract - Short summary of the review (In early years, this was the first sentence-ish)
review - Full review text
art - Link to the album artwork

The infomation found in some of the features is very messy, so there is some cleaning that needs to be done if you want to use it.

The file Pitchfork_Scraper.ipynb contains the code used to collect the data. There are improvements that could be made to it.
I'd recommend only scraping the data in batches, creating a feature that saves missed reviews and pages for scraping later, and pickling the data as you
collect it.
